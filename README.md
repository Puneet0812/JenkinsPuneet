# Jenkins GitHub CI/CD Integration

This repository demonstrates the integration of **Jenkins with GitHub** for automated **Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)** using **GitHub Webhooks**. The pipeline is triggered automatically when changes are pushed to the repository.

---

## **Project Overview**
The purpose of this project is to configure **Jenkins** to detect code changes in a GitHub repository and trigger an automated **CI/CD pipeline**. The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. **Checkout** - Pulls the latest changes from GitHub.
2. **Build** - Simulates a build process.
3. **Test** - Runs basic test commands.
4. **Deploy** (Optional) - Deploys the application (if configured).
5. **Notification** - Sends an email notification upon success or failure.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Jenkins** - CI/CD automation server.
- **GitHub** - Source code repository.
- **Git** - Version control system.
- **Ngrok** - Exposes localhost to the internet for GitHub Webhooks.
